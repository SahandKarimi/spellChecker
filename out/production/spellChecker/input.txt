Every state has a constitution of its own, like every game having some rules of its own. Football has one set of rules and the cricket has a different set of rules. These rules
for the state are called the constitutions. These rules are there to fix the structure
of the supreme government. Every state must have a constitution, since every state functions
on the basis of certain rules and principles.
