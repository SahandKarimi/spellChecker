# Java Spell Checker

This is a improved version of this [old spell checker](https://raelcunha.com/2007/08/24/how-to-write-a-spell-checker/) that I've built in Java based in the [original](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) Peter Norvig spell checker built on python.

This version is a way faster then the Java demonstration version.

# Run

After clone this repo, just enter it's folder and compile `Spelling.java`. Then run it in the command line with the incorrect word as param: 

     javac Spelling.java
     java Spelling speling
     
This should output `spelling`.
